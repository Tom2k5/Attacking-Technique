# DLL Hijacking

**DLL hijacking** is tricking a legitimate/trusted application into loading an arbitrary DLL. 
- **Execution** - executing malicious code through a trusted executable, some cases bypass whitelist features such as AppLocker.
- **Persistence** - if target application runs regularly.
- **Privileged Escalation** - if the target application runs under elavated permissions.

**There is a variety of approaches to conduct DLL hijacking:**
- DLL replacement
- DLL search order hijacking
- Phantom DLL hijacking
- DLL redirection
- WinSxS DLL replacement
- Relative path DLL Hijacking

```ad-note
The success of conducting **DLL hijacking** depends how the application is configured to load its required DLLs.
```

| **DLL replacement**             | Replace a legitimate DLL with an evil DLL. This can be combined with _DLL Proxying_ [[2](https://kevinalmansa.github.io/application%20security/DLL-Proxying/)], which ensures all functionality of the original DLL remains intact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **DLL search order hijacking**  | DLLs specified by an application without a path are searched for in fixed locations in a specific order [[3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order)]. Hijacking the search order takes place by putting the evil DLL in a location that is searched in before the actual DLL. This sometimes includes the working directory of the target application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Phantom DLL hijacking**       | Drop an evil DLL in place of a missing/non-existing DLL that a legitimate application tries to load [[4](http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2013/12/08/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-5/)].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **DLL redirection**             | Change the location in which the DLL is searched for, e.g. by editing the `%PATH%` environment variable, or `.exe.manifest` / `.exe.local` files to include the folder containing the evil DLL [[5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests), [6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-redirection)] .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **WinSxS DLL replacement**      | Replace the legitimate DLL with the evil DLL in the relevant WinSxS folder of the targeted DLL. Often referred to as DLL side-loading [[7](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-dll-sideloading.pdf)].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Relative path DLL Hijacking** | Copy (and optionally rename) the legitimate application to a user-writeable folder, alongside the evil DLL. In the way this is used, it has similarities with (Signed) Binary Proxy Execution [[8](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/)]. A variation of this is (somewhat oxymoronically called) ‘_bring your own LOLbin_’ [[9](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/09/26/bring-your-own-lolbin-multi-stage-fileless-nodersok-campaign-delivers-rare-node-js-based-malware/)] in which the legitimate application is brought with the evil DLL (rather than copied from the legitimate location on the victim’s machine). |
