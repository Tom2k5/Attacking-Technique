# **ATTACKING DEMO**

## Summary
We will focus on a specific hijack involving the vulnerable executable **calc.exe** and a list of DLLs that can be hijacked.

Attempt the hijack using **"calc.exe"** and **"WININET.dll"** as an example, utilizing Stephen Fewer's **"hello world"** [reflective DLL](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/tree/master/bin):
- Renaming `reflective_dll.x64.dll` to `WININET.dll`.
- Moving `calc.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32` along with `WININET.dll` to a writable directory (such as the `Desktop`).
- Executing `calc.exe`, we achieve success.
Instead of the Calculator application, a [MessageBox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messageboxa) is displayed.

## Detailed

1. Renaming `reflective_dll.x64.dll` to `WININET.dll`

2. Moving `calc.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32` along with `WININET.dll` to a writable directory (such as the `Desktop`)

3. Executing `calc.exe` => Hijack **wininet.dll** on

- At the juncture, you moved **WININET.dll** to other directory (such as `\Downloads`), then ran it.
	=> You will see **calc.exe** will show original program.

- The reason to explain is **DLL Search Order** mechanism. Program like **calc.exe** could not find **evil wininet.dll** on Application Directory. It found on System Directory, the legitimate one.
